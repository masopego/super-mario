# Super Mario App 🎮

I love Super Mario too 🥁! So, I want to share my particular version of this Super Mario application with all my study partners. Come in, enjoy my code, and meet your favorite characters!
## ▶️ To start

It is time you could see your fav characters. I suggest you two essay ways to do it: 

-  Star by **cloning or downloading this project**. Remember to clean the project before start, and run "app": 


Super Mario App is now running at your emulator or your personal device

- Or go down or click here to see Super Mario's demo: [SuperMario App](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35d0e887-b3b1-423c-b526-fa083ccae3d9)

**Let's the Mario's App play! 🎷**

Have fun selecting your favorite Mario characters and learning more about their history.
